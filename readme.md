Code is based on

http://davidstutz.de/implementing-tensorflow-operations-in-c-including-gradients/

I want to implement a dense layer to get familiar with custom tensorflow ops in c++.

Build module

 rm -rf build
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 cd ..
 python dense_tests.py 
 python main.py

Beware this is work in progress and not working yet!
